                <!-- Part 1 -->
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/porcelain-house.jpg" alt="Porcelain House">
                    <figcaption>Lynelle Chen, 2019</figcaption>

                <p>This image is a part of my archive of interesting tourist attractions from different provinces I visited in China. One of the things that stood out to me is how the house does not appear very Chinese despite having Chinese characters at the entrance. The bright orange color emphasizes the large amount of broken porcelain on the house which reminds me of a mural. There is also an interesting entanglement to the right of the image. It seems like someone did not know what to do with their entire collection and decided to make a tourist attraction, especially with the nice display of plates on the balcony ceiling.</p>

                <p>I think my collection might represent a part of my culture's past. China has been developing quite fast in recent decades, so my pictures show how quickly things feel out of place there. It is definitely how I felt when I visited the first time in 14 years!</p>

                <!-- Part 2 -->
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/art-gallery.png" alt="Art Gallery">
                    <figcaption>Hitesh Rohra</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>Hitesh's image is a piece from his architecture collection, an art gallery with different lighting conditions applied. I found the ceiling windows above the art pieces to be very interesting. In addition to the large window, they do a nice job of adding subtle lighting and showing how the outside would look depending on the interior lighting. The sharp lines balance well with the round lights and sculpture. I can also see how the minimal colors would contrast well with colorful art pieces. I think the most most mysterious aspect is how the sculpture and back of the gallery illuminate, and how different lighting conditions help emphasize different parts of the room.</p>
