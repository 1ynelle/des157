        <h1>Final Project Brief</h1>

        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>For my final, I intend to expand my Every Picture project to add more context to the images of provinces I visited in China.</p>

        <h2>Comparison Project 1</h2>
        <p>Schneider Styling's site effectively uses colors to differentiate a stylist's different collections. The background color overlay helps the visitor focus on the image they are hovering over in the home screen. Clicking on these feature images of the the collection reveals that the background color is also present in each of the images in the collection, tying everything together. The images sliding away on click feels like I'm looking through a pile of pictures without having to scroll through a long list of images. Although, I have to go through the whole image collection before seeing a next button to move on to the next collection. There isn't really a way to bring back a previous image without reloading, but the transition is a nice idea for storytelling.</p>

        <h2>Comparison Project 2</h2>
        <p>I found the image click and drag on LM Chabot's site to be fun because I can group the images however I want. It feels like putting images in a pile and hovering over one of them gives a quick slideshow preview of the images in the collection. The title of the image appears and rotates around the image on hover, which adds to the interactivity but makes it hard to read. I found the sharp contrast between the colorful images and white background / sans-serif font to fit well with the geometric shapes in the pictures. In comparison to the previous site, hovering over an image brings it to the forefront, so I can click on a specific image without have to click through an entire stack.</p>

        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <p>My goal for this project is to add more context to the pictures I took, and make it feel like interacting with physical images. For example, picking up an image and being able to see more details (culture comparison, what it feels like visiting there). I might also include elements that aren't possible when viewing a physical image - zooming in, same subject but from a different angle, etc. I hope to incorporate the interactivity of going through a group of images like the above sites - using transitions to show an image is in focus and part of a collection, colors or patterns to group images, and background that emphasizes the main content.</p>


        <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>sans-serif or handwritten font to make site feel like travel log</li>

            <li>collection of images from different provinces
                <ul>
                    <li>differentiate between collections using colors or image content
                        <ul>
                            <li>background elements - travel stickers, location in comparison to other cities</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>feature image on the home screen of the different province collections, maybe a short text description of the places or an intro statement describing what the images are and how to navigate the site
                <ul>
                    <li>clicking each image expands the collection</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>arrow to move on to next collection or picture</li>
        </ul>
        

        <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Slideshow preview when hovering over feature image on homepage</li>
            <li>Bring an image to the front on hover</li>
            <li>User clicks on image â†’ enlarged version and further text description, slideshow?</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Experience Strategies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Experience Strategies</li>
            <li>Food, elements symbolic of the province</li>
            <li>"Picking up" an image / enlarging image on click</li>
        </ul>
